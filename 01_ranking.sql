-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | id          | int     |
-- | score       | decimal |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.
 

-- Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

-- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
-- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
-- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.
-- Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

select score,
dense_rank() over (order by score desc) as 'rank'
from scores

-- обратить внимание - часть Partition by нужна только если ранжирование нужно разделить на подмножества, внутри которых в дальнейшем и будет работаь функция ранжирования
