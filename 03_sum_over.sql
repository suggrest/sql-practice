-- Table: Queue

-- +-------------+---------+
-- | Column Name | Type    |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- | person_id   | int     |
-- | person_name | varchar |
-- | weight      | int     |
-- | turn        | int     |
-- +-------------+---------+
-- person_id column contains unique values.
-- This table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.
-- The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
-- turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to board.
-- weight is the weight of the person in kilograms.
 

-- There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

-- Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

-- Note that only one person can board the bus at any given turn.

select person_name from
(select *, sum(weight) over (order by turn) as wght
from queue) as tmp
where wght <= 1000
order by turn desc
limit 1

-- Table: Customer

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | customer_id   | int     |
-- | name          | varchar |
-- | visited_on    | date    |
-- | amount        | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
-- This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
-- visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
-- amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

-- You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

-- Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

-- Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

select visited_on, amount, average_amount
from (select visited_on,
       sum(amount) over (order by visited_on rows between 6 preceding and current row) as amount,
       round(avg(amount) over (order by visited_on rows between 6 preceding and current row),2) as average_amount,
       row_number() over (order by visited_on) as row_rank
from
(select visited_on, sum(amount) as amount
from customer
group by visited_on) as tmp) as tmp1
where row_rank > 6
